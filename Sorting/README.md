# Kotlin implementation of Sorting Algorithms

- Merge Sort
    - Recursion: T(N) = T(N/2) + N
    - Time: NLogN (always)
    - Space: N
- Quick Sort
    - Recursion: T(N) = T(N/2) + N or T(N) = T(N - 1) + N
    - Time: NLogN best and avg case N^2 worst case.
    - Space: Log N for the recursion in the best case. N in worst case.
